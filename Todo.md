# TODO

## Features to implement

>Highlight differences: Modify the gui.py file to include a custom Text widget that supports line highlighting based on comparison results.
 
>Ignore whitespace and case: Update the comparison.py file to include options for ignoring whitespace and case differences. Add corresponding checkboxes to the gui.py file to enable/disable these options.

>Filter comparison: Add a filter dropdown menu or radio buttons in the gui.py file for selecting the display mode (differences, identical lines, or both). Update the comparison.py file to return the results based on the selected mode.

>Side-by-side comparison: Modify the gui.py file to display two Text widgets side-by-side for the original files, and a third Text widget for the comparison results. Implement synchronized scrolling for the side-by-side Text widgets.
